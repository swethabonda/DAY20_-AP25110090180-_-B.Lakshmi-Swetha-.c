This C program creates a basic billing system.
It first takes input for multiple products such as product ID, name, quantity, and price.
Then it builds a bill by storing all product information in arrays and calculating the total price for each product.
Finally, it prints a well-formatted bill showing ID, Name, Quantity, Price, Total for each item along with the Grand Total.
The program uses functions, arrays, loops, and basic arithmetic to organize and display the bill cleanly.
